          up a huge stateful monolithic service into composable microservices.
    \item Built a deployment service, which enabled quick editing and testing of
          different LLM pipelines via a simple YAML specification.
    \item Wrote a Visual Programming Language to allow designers to create
          complex Amazon Alexa Skills, without code, shortening R\&D cycles.
    \item Rewrote an internal HTTP library, fixing many concurrency bugs.
    \item Introduced type safe Python, which reduced many edge-case bugs.
  \end{itemize}

  \datedsubsection{Research Engineer - Emotech}{2017 - 2018}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Built a Visual Programming Language to allow designers to create
          complex behaviour, without code, for a smart-home robot assistant,
          shortening R\&D cycles from days/weeks to hours/minutes.
    \item Wrote dozens of Golang Microservices each responsible for a different
          part of the robot's functionality, optimised for low latency.
    \item Built a Natural Language Generation Engine, which augments the
          robot's speech with contextual information, and a hint of personality.
    \item Introduced Trello to my workmates, championing Agile practices, and
          improving communication and productivity across the company.
